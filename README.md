# teaching_python

Publicly accessible repository for undergraduate students at OvGU and all other living beings with an interest in PsychoPy. Here is a step-by-step explanation of how to design an experiment and convert it into Python code. If someone finds a bug, the person will get a beer or a warm handshake (or both) at the next conference.   

**Important:** The stimulus materials used in the experiment were obtained from: 
- https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/ 
- https://thiscatdoesnotexist.com/
- The only exception is 'cat_5.jpg', which is Gizmo. My chubby cat.

Furthermore, the repository will be expanded at irregular intervals throughout the semester. There is an accompanying video of the creation of this - for actual research unsuitable - experiment at the following address (be beware, it is in german):

(1) Video I - Introduction: TBA <br>
(2) Video II - Core Principles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUdvQr2UrM <br>
(3) Video III - User Interaction: TBA<br>
