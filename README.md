# teaching_python_experiments

Publicly accessible repository for undergraduate students at OvGU and all other living beings with an interest in PsychoPy. Here is a step-by-step explanation of how to design an experiment and convert it into Python code. If someone finds a bug, the person will get a beer or a warm handshake (or both) at the next conference.   

**Important:** The stimulus materials used in the experiment were obtained from https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/ and https://thiscatdoesnotexist.com/. The only exception is 'cat_5.jpg', which is Gizmo. My chubby cat.

Furthermore, the repository will be expanded at irregular intervals throughout the semester. There is an accompanying video of the creation of this - for actual research unsuitable - experiment at the following address: *** But beware, it is in german.
